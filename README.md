The past few weeks I've been helping my mom in one of her classes focused around `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`. In doing so, I've learned a lot about web design. In the past, I've created websites using Wix and SquareSpace. This time, I want to try to create a website for myself from scratch. I'm starting college in about a week, so I want to use this site to document things I'm learning and projects I'll do in the future. Hopefuly, I can keep up with it and not forget about it.
